## Credits.

- ## Content.
  - The idea to make a news style project was from the assessment guide and the django learning module that was provided.
  - Research into news websites was all first hand research by searching and interacting with big news sites such as;
    - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) , [Sky News](https://news.sky.com/uk) and [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news).
  - For deployment within this project, [Heroku](https://heroku.com) was the method used.

- ### Code.
  - The code in this project was inspired by the walkthrough project of the I Think Therefore I Blog project with all the django being taught was learned from there.
  - Snippets of code throughout the project are also inspired from this project as it was needed to either install, import, or create paths throughout the various apps in the project.
  - Finally, the models in my project are inspired by the walkthrough project however, I have altered them to become unique and fit my own project.
